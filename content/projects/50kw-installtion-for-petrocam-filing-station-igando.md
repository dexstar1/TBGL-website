  ### PROJECT SCOPE

  A 50kw hybrid solar power plant was designed & constructed by TBGL in August 2019, providing energy to Petrocam filling station at Igando, which has led to a reduction drastically in the cost of running the station on a diesel generator.
  
  #### Project Overview
  
  TBGL commissioned a 50kw Hybrid Solar Roof System for Petrocam filling station in August 2019, using the cell and modules manufactured by Canadian Solar.
  
  The solar modules were installed on the roof building of the filling station.
  
  The hybrid solar system was completed in a record time of 1 month and was commissioned in August 2019.

  ### CHALLENGES

  #### Installation of The PV Module on The Roof  Building of The Filling Station

  Our team adopted special techniques in transporting the PV module to ensure the safety of the team and proper handling of the PV modules to the roof building of the filling station at heights of 9 meters.

  #### Maintaining Site Ecology.

  The PV modules were installed to ensure self-cleaning while guaranteeing that the water erosion from the PV modules was properly channelled to the drainage system.

  #### Earning Community Trust & Confidence.

  We employed artisans, as well as the community, were educated on the benefits of having a sustainable source of energy in the form of a solar power plant and about the ecoâ€“friendly design using the constructed solar system as a case study.

  ### IMPACT
  
  #### Promote Jobs & Growth
  
  Our team trained and employed the local artisans and workers in the areas of project operation & maintenance, opening a new source of livelihood for the people.

  #### Power Generation
  
  The 50kw hybrid Solar Roof System supplies electricity to Petrocam filling station at Igando which serve as a main source of power to the filling station permanent substitute for public electricity and save huge cost on running & maintenance of diesel generator.

  #### Eco-Tourism Enhancement
  
  The solar System design attracts more customers to Petrocam filling station.
