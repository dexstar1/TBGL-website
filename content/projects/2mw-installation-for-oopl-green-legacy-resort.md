  ### PROJECT SCOPE

  TBGL commissioned a 2MW hybrid solar carport system for OOPL & Green Legacy Resort in December 2021 using cells & modules manufactured by Jinko Solar. 
  
  The project was built on the car park space of the hotel & resort and serves as a car park for guest cars. 
  The hybrid solar carport system was completed in a record time of 6 months and was commissioned in December 2021.

  ### CHALLENGES

  #### Construction Of The Solar Car Port.  

  The 2mega watts hybrid solar system supplies power to the whole OOPL. It works synchronically with the grid/ PHCN and Generator.

  #### Maintaining Site Ecology. 

  The solar carport was designed to ensure self-cleaning of the PV modules while guaranteeing that the water erosion from the PV modules was properly channelled to the drainage system. 

  #### Earning Community Trust And Confidence. 

  We employed local artisans and local sub-contractors as well as the community were educated on the benefits of having a sustainable source of energy in the form of a solar power plant and about the ecoâ€“friendly design using the constructed solar system as a case study.

  ### IMPACT

  #### Promote Jobs & Growth. 

  Our team trained and employed the local artesans & community workers in the areas of project operation & maintenance, opening a new source of livelihood for the people. 
  
  #### Power Generation

  The 2MW hybrid solar carport system supplies electricity to OOPL & Green Legacy Resort which make them now generate power at a very low cost thereby saving cost from high running & maintenance on diesel generator & constant increment in tariff rate of public electricity (PHCN)
  
  #### Eco-Tourism Enhancement
  
  The solar carport system design attracts guests to OOPL & Green Legacy Resort.
