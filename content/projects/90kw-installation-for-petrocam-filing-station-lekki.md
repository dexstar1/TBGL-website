  ### PROJECT SCOPE

  A 90kw hybrid solar power plant was designed & constructed by TBGL in September 2017, providing energy to the Petrocam filling station at Lekki, which has led to a reduction drastically in the cost of running the station on a diesel generator.

  #### Project Overview
  
  TBGL commissioned a 90kw Hybrid Solar Roof System for Petrocam filling station in September 2017, using the cell and modules manufactured by Canadian Solar.

  The solar modules were constructed as a roof for the nozzle pumps of the filling station.

  The hybrid solar roof system was completed in a record time of 2 months and was commissioned in September 2017.


  ### CHALLENGES

  #### Construction Of The Solar Roof.

  Our team adopted special techniques in the solar roof design as covering all the nozzle pumps & customers' cars buying fuel and also to be able to support the weight of the PV module, at the roof height of 6 meters.

  #### Maintaining Site Ecology.

  The solar roof was designed to ensure self-cleaning of the PV modules while guaranteeing that the water erosion from the PV modules was properly channelled to the drainage system.

  #### Earning Community Trust & Confidence.

  We employed artisans and sub-contractors, as well as the community, were educated on the benefits of having a sustainable source of energy in the form of a solar power plant and about the ecoâ€“friendly design using the constructed solar system as a case study.

  ### IMPACT

  #### Promote Jobs & Growth. 

  Our team trained and employed the local artisans and workers in the areas of project operation & maintenance, opening a new source of livelihood for the people.
  
  #### Power Generation

  The 90kw hybrid Solar Roof System supplies electricity to Petrocam filling station which serves as a main source of power to the filling station permanent substitute for public electricity and saves huge costs on running & maintenance of diesel generator.
  
  #### Eco-Tourism Enhancement
  
  The Solar Roof System design attracts more customers to Petrocam filling station.
