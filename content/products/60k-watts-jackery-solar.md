  ## PROJECT SCOPE

  TBGL commissioned a 2MW hybrid solar carport system for OOPL & Green Legacy Resort in December 2021 using cells & modules manufactured by Jinko Solar. 
  
  The project was built on the car park space of the hotel & resort and serves as a car park for guest cars. 
  The hybrid solar carport system was completed in a record time of 6 months and was commissioned in December 2021.

  ## CHALLENGES

  ### Construction Of The Solar Car Port.  

  Our team adopted special techniques in the Solar carport design to fit the car park spaces and also to be able to support the weight of the PV modules, at the car port height of 2.5meters. 

  ### Maintaining Site Ecology. 

  The solar carport was designed to ensure self-cleaning of the PV modules while guaranteeing that the water erosion from the PV modules was properly channelled to the drainage system. 

  ### Earning Community Trust And Confidence. 

  We employed local artisans and local sub-contractors as well as the community were educated on the benefits of having a sustainable source of energy in the form of a solar power plant and about the ecoâ€“friendly design using the constructed solar system as a case study.

  ## IMPACT

  ### Promote Jobs & Growth. 

  Our team trained and employed the local artesans & community workers in the areas of project operation & maintenance, opening a new source of livelihood for the people. 
  
  ### Power Generation

  The 2MW hybrid solar carport system supplies electricity to OOPL & Green Legacy Resort which make them now generate power at a very low cost thereby saving cost from high running & maintenance on diesel generator & constant increment in tariff rate of public electricity (PHCN)
  
  ### Eco-Tourism Enhancement
  
  The solar carport system design attracts guests to OOPL & Green Legacy Resort.
